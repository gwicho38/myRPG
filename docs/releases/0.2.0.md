**Release Date:** 2025-10-06

## Overview

This release introduces a complete **Terminal Edition** of Luminus RPG that runs in modern terminal emulators (Kitty, Ghostty, iTerm2, etc.). This is a major feature addition that makes the game playable in pure text mode with colorful graphics, intelligent enemy AI, and smooth animations.

## Major Features

### 🎮 Complete Terminal Game Implementation

- **Full Game Playable in Terminal:** ASCII/Unicode-based rendering using the blessed library
- **Three-Panel UI Layout:**
  - Game viewport (70% width) - Shows the world and entities
  - Status panel (30% width) - Player stats, health bars, XP tracking
  - Event log (bottom 20%) - Scrollable combat and game messages
- **Controls:** Arrow keys/WASD for movement, Space/J for attack, B/K for block

### 🗺️ Colorful Overworld System

- **Vibrant Village World:** Replaced grey dungeon with colorful overworld
- **14 Different Tile Types:**
  - 🌿 Green grass covering the entire map
  - 🏘️ Four houses with red roofs and walls

  - 🌳 30 randomly placed trees
  - 🌸 20 flowers for visual variety
  - ≈ 15 bushes scattered around
  - 💎 Hidden treasure chests
- **Background Color Rendering:** Tiles use colored backgrounds for reliable visibility across terminal themes

### 🤖 Intelligent Enemy AI

- **Dynamic Enemy Movement:**
  - Enemies chase player when within 10-tile detection range
  - Random wandering when player is far away (30% move chance)
  - Smart pathfinding that avoids walls, water, trees, and other entities
  - Diagonal movement with fallback to horizontal/vertical
- **Game Loop:** Updates every 500ms for smooth enemy behavior

## Breaking Changes

None - Terminal version is a separate mode that doesn't affect the existing Phaser-based game.

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run terminal version
npm run terminal

# Run with debug mode
npm run terminal:debug
```

## Architecture

The terminal version uses:
- **blessed** - Terminal UI framework
- **tsx** - TypeScript execution
- **Shared game logic** - Reuses EntityAttributes and core game systems
- **Independent rendering** - Separate from Phaser web version

### Key Components

- `TerminalRenderer` - UI layout and blessed screen management
- `TerminalGame` - Game loop, input handling, combat system
- `TerminalMap` - World generation and tile rendering
- `TerminalEntity` - Entity representation with animation support
- `TerminalAnimator` - Combat animation effects
