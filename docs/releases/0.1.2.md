# Release 0.1.2

**Release Date:** October 15, 2025

## Summary

Fixed multiple critical issues with the minimap (LuminusMinimap plugin) positioning and rendering. The minimap now correctly displays the full game map in the bottom-right corner with proper containment within its border and accurate player position tracking.

## Changes from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2

### Features
- **Full Map View**: Minimap now displays the entire 100x100 tilemap instead of a zoomed view around the player
- **Improved Positioning**: Minimap repositioned to bottom-right corner of the screen

### Bug Fixes
- **Render Texture Origin**: Fixed render texture origin from default (0.5, 0.5) to (0, 0) for proper alignment
- **Bounds Rendering**: Map content now properly contained within white border frame
- **Tile Bounds Checking**: Added strict bounds checking to ensure tiles only render when completely within frame
- **Player Marker Accuracy**: Player marker now correctly reflects position in game world

### Technical Changes

#### `src/plugins/HUD/LuminusMinimap.ts`
- Added `showFullMap` boolean property (set to `true`) to control map display mode
- Modified constructor positioning from bottom-left to bottom-right:
  - Changed from: `this.x = this.padding`
  - Changed to: `this.x = this.scene.cameras.main.width - this.width - this.padding`
- Fixed render texture origin in `create()` method:
  - Added: `this.mapTexture.setOrigin(0, 0)`
- Implemented full map rendering logic in `renderMap()`:
  - Added conditional logic for `showFullMap` vs area-around-player rendering
  - Full map shows entire bounds (0, 0) to (map.width, map.height)
- Updated tile rendering bounds checking:
  - Changed from partial overlap check to complete containment check
  - Ensures tiles are fully within minimap bounds before drawing
- Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting:
  - Scale calculations
  - Render bounds
  - Player position with percentage markers
  - Actual draw bounds verification
- Removed unused variables (`tilesRendered`, `firstTileLogged`)
- Updated resize method to maintain bottom-right positioning

#### `package.json`
- Version bumped from 0.1.1 to 0.1.2

### Code Quality
- Linting: All ESLint issues resolved
- Build: Application builds successfully
- No breaking changes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
- ✅ Minimap displays in bottom-right corner
- ✅ Full 100x100 map visible within minimap frame
- ✅ All map content contained within white border
- ✅ Player marker accurately positioned at ~38%, 41% (tile 38, 41)
- ✅ Player marker moves correctly as player moves through world
- ✅ Build successful with only expected asset size warnings
- ✅ Linting clean (0 errors, only pre-existing warnings in other files)

### Known Issues
None

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing code continues to work without modifications.

If you want to switch back to the zoomed view around the player, set:
```typescript
showFullMap: boolean = false;
```
