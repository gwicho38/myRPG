# NeverQuest RPG Terminal Edition - Code Review & Improvement Suggestions

## Overview

This document outlines improvement suggestions for the CLI-only version of NeverQuest RPG (entry point: `npm run terminal`). The terminal version is well-structured but has several areas for enhancement.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Organization

### High Priority

- [ ] **Separate game logic from terminal rendering** - Currently `TerminalGame.ts` mixes game logic with terminal-specific code. Extract core game mechanics into a shared `GameEngine` class that both web and terminal versions can use.
- [ ] **Create proper state management** - Implement a centralized game state manager to handle player stats, inventory, world state, and game progression.
- [ ] **Add proper error handling** - Currently lacks comprehensive error handling for edge cases like invalid spawn positions, animation failures, or terminal compatibility issues.
- [ ] **Implement configuration system** - Add a config file for game settings, terminal compatibility options, and user preferences.

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Refactor entity system** - The `TerminalEntity` class duplicates a lot of logic from the main `Player` class. Create a shared base entity system.
- [ ] **Add proper TypeScript interfaces** - Many functions use `any` types or lack proper type definitions.
- [ ] **Create modular plugin system** - Allow for easy addition of new features like different map types, enemy behaviors, or UI components.

## üéÆ Game Features & Mechanics

### High Priority

- [ ] **Implement save/load system** - Currently no way to save game progress. Add JSON-based save system compatible with web version.
- [ ] **Add inventory system** - Terminal version lacks item management, equipment, and consumables that exist in the web version.
- [ ] **Implement leveling system** - Player can gain XP but there's no level-up mechanics, stat allocation, or progression.
- [ ] **Add quest/objective system** - No goals or objectives for the player to work towards.

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Enhance combat system** - Add critical hits, different weapon types, status effects, and more complex combat mechanics.
- [ ] **Implement NPCs and dialogue** - Add non-player characters with conversation trees and quest givers.
- [ ] **Add different map types** - Currently only has overworld generation. Add dungeons, caves, and other environments.
- [ ] **Create day/night cycle** - Add time progression with different enemy spawns and visual changes.

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Add weather system** - Rain, snow, and other weather effects that affect gameplay.
- [ ] **Implement multiplayer support** - Terminal-based multiplayer via shared sessions or network play.
- [ ] **Add sound effects** - Terminal bell sounds or audio cues for actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal UI & UX

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (Critical)**: Architecture refactoring, save/load system, proper error handling
2. **Phase 2 (Important)**: Inventory system, leveling, quest system, UI improvements
3. **Phase 3 (Enhancement)**: Advanced features, content expansion, performance optimization
4. **Phase 4 (Polish)**: Documentation, testing, cross-platform compatibility

## Notes

- The terminal version shows good separation of concerns with dedicated classes for rendering, animation, and game logic
- The blessed.js integration is well-implemented but could benefit from better error handling
- The shared entity system between web and terminal versions is a good foundation but needs better abstraction
- The animation system is creative and effective for terminal constraints
- Code quality is generally good but lacks comprehensive testing and documentation
